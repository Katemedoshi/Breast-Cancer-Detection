# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based classification model designed to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign. The model is trained on a dataset containing various tumor characteristics and uses classification algorithms to make predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features related to tumor measurements.
It includes attributes such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
The target variable classifies tumors as malignant (1) or benign (0).
Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this notebook:

pandas – for data manipulation
numpy – for numerical operations
matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization
sklearn (Scikit-learn) – for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing
Steps in the Notebook
Data Loading
The dataset is imported into a pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data visualization and statistical insights are extracted.
Correlation analysis is performed to identify important features.
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values (if any).
Encoding categorical variables (if applicable).
Feature scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
Model Selection & Training
Different classification models are tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
Model Evaluation
Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Predictions & Conclusion
The trained model is used to make predictions on test data.
Final insights and possible improvements are discussed.
How to Run the Notebook
Install the required dependencies using:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Open Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence.
Ensure the dataset file (if applicable) is in the correct directory.
Future Enhancements
Implementing deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).
Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
Deployment of the model using Flask or FastAPI.
